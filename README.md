# Sleep-Health-and-Lifestyle-Analysis-using-SQL

I have used 200 rows of a public domain dataset for this project based on sleep health and lifestyle .

The dataset has the following columns:

1.Person ID

2.Gender

3.Age

4.Occupation

5.Sleep Duration in hours

6. Quality of sleep ranging from 1 to 10

7. Physical Activity Level in terms of minutes per day

8. Stress Level ranging from 1 to 10

9. BMI Category

10. Blood Pressure

11. Heart Rate in bpm

12. Daily Steps

13. Sleep Disorder

I have analyzed the data using SQL . Here are the top 3 insights I have gathered:

1.Lawyers and Engineers have the highest amount of average sleep duration whereas Scientists and Sales Representatives have the least amount of average sleep duration

2.people having the quality of sleep of 4 out of 10 have the highest amount of average stress levels whereas people having the best quality sleep of 9 out 10 have the least amount of average stress level

3.people of ages 30 and 40 years have the highest sleep duration whereas people of ages 28 and 34 years have the least sleep duration
